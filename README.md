# google-cloud-run-python-job

This repository provides a template to quickly get a Cloud Run Job tested and deployed
with a GitHub Actions-powered CI/CD pipeline.

For more information on how to configure the GitHub Actions provided, check out [the
Notion guide](https://eastern-diagnostic-580.notion.site/Set-up-CI-CD-for-Google-Cloud-Run-with-Github-Actions-de0624a66b244d829517c9bf77c89dcb).

When you're done, check out the `teardown.sh` [script](scripts/teardown.sh) which will
remove any deployed resources you may have.
